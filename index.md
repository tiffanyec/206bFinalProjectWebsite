## Project Overview

The goal of our project was to have a multifingered robotic hand be able to reshape a soft object into a desired shape. This functionality could be utilized in industries where soft and malleable objects need to be reshaped consistently or in places where the object needing to be reshaped could consist of potentially harmful chemicals or materials and a human could potentially be exposed to danger or harm. Replacing the human with a robotic arm capable of performing the same task would decrease the risk of a person getting harmed while also increasing the consistency of the reshaping. Some examples of industries in which this could be utilized include the food processing industry, biomedical processing, and robotized surgery.
